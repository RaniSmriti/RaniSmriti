### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work with TCS Research with the Embedded Systems and Devices Group

I am interested in signal processing, machine learning and data science.

We can collaborate on radar centric signal processing, machine learning and tiny ML projects.



You can reach me at gmail - rani.smriti09@gmail.com and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smriti-rani-12116a29/)

Interested in papers I published ??
